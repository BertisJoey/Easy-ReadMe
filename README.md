Javascript that was written to make it easy to generate a readMe for any repository

## Installation/Usage
1. You can clone this repo to use this code here https://github.com/BertisJoey/Easy-ReadMe.git
2. VS Code was used to run this program
3. node.js must be installed to at least v16, I used v16.20.1
